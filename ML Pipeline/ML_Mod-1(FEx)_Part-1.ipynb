    "### Feature Extraction\n",
    "- It is a Process of transforming raw data  into a simplified and informative set of features (or) attributes.\n",
    "- Improving model accuracy and reducing computational costs by  focusing on essential aspects of the data.\n",
    "- This reduce cpmplexity and highlights the most relevant information making it easier for machine learning models to analyze and learn from the data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Techniques of Feature Extraction:\n",
    "#### 1. Statistical Methods:\n",
    "- To summarixe and explains patterns of data.\n",
    "- Mean - The average of data values in the dataset.\n",
    "- Median - The Mid value when it is sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation - A measure of the spread (or) dispersion of sample.\n",
    "- Correlation and Covarience - Measures of the linear relationship between two (or) more factors.\n",
    "- Regression Analysis - A way to model the link between a dependent variable and one-more independent variables.\n",
    "#### 2. Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "- It reduces the number of features without losing important features.\n",
    "#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \n",
    "- It is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for dimensionality reduction in datasets with a large number of features.\n",
    "- While keeping the most important features.\n",
    "#### Linear Discriminant Analysis\n",
    "- It ia also called Normal Discrminant analysis.\n",
    "- It is a supervised classification problem that helps seperate one (or) more classes by converting higher-dimensional data to lower-dimensional data.\n",
    "- It is used for linear combination of features that best separates classes with in a dataset.\n",
    "#### T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) Algorithm\n",
    "- It is a non linear dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional in a small-dimensional space on mainly in 2D (or) 3D.\n",
    "- In other words, A technique that reduces high-dimensional data into two (or) more dimensions ideal for visualizing complex datasets."
