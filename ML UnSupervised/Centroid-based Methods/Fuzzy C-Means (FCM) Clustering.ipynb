    "### Working of Fuzzy Clustering:\n",
    "#### Step 1: Initialize Membership Values Randomly:\n",
    "- Each data point is given random membership scores for all clusters. A point can partially belong to multiple clusters.\n",
    "#### Step 2: Compute cluster centroids:\n",
    "- Centroids are calculated as weighted averages, which weights are membership values raised to the fuzziness parameter m.\n",
    "#### Step 3: Calculate Distance between data points and centroids:\n",
    "- Calculate the Euclidean distance between each point and every centroid to dtermine proximity, which will be used for to update memberships.\n",
    "#### Step 4: Update Membership Values:\n",
    "- Membership values are updated inversly proportional to the these distances. Points closer to a centroid get higher membership.\n",
    "#### Step 5: Repeat Until Convergence:\n",
    "- Steps 2-4 are repeated until the membership values stabilize meaning there is no significant changes from one iteration to another.\n",
    "- This indicate that the clustering has reached an optimal state."
