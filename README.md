### Machine Learning:
- ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focus on developing models and algorithms that let cpmouters learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.
- In simple Words, ML teaches systems to think and understand like humans by learning from data.

### Types of Machine Learning:
- There are three main types of Machine learning.
### 1. Supervised Learning:
- Trains models on labelled data to predict (or) classify new, unseen data.
- Supervised Learning can be classified into Two types.They are -
  1. Regression - where the goal is to predict continous numerical values.
  2. Classification - Where goal is to predict discrete labels (or) categories.
#### Types of different supervised learning algorithms:
#### 1. Linear Regression:
- To predict numbers using a straight line.
- It helps the relationship between the input and output.
- Here,
  1. Introduction to Linear Regression
  2. Gradient Descent in Linear Regression
  3. Multiple Linear Regression
#### 2. Logistic Regression:
- To predict the categories (or) discrete labels.
- Here,
  1. Understanding Logistic Regression
  2. Cost function in Logistic Regression
#### 3. Decision Trees:
- A model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like flowchart.
- Here,
  1. Decision Tree in Machine Learning.
  2. Types of Decision tree algorithms.
  3. Decision Tree - Regression
  4. Decision Tree - Classification
#### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
- A bit more advanced- it tries to draw the best line to seperate different categories of data.
- Here,
  1. Understanding SVM's
  2. SVM Hyperparameter Tuning - GridSearchCV
  3. Non-Linear SVM
#### 5. Naive Bayes :
- A Quick and smart way to classify things based on the probability.
- It works well for text and spam detection.
- Here, Types of Naive Bayes.
  1. Introduction to Random forest
  2. Random Forest Classifier
  3. Random Forest Regression
  4. Hyperparameter Tuning in Random Forest
#### 6. Ensemble Learning:
- It Combines multiple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types. They are -
- Here,
  1. Bagging - That combines multiple models trained independently.
  2. Boosting - That builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one.
