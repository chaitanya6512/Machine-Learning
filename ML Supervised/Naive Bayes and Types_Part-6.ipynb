    "### What is Naive Bayes?\n",
    "- Naive Bayers is a machine learning classification algorithm that predicts based on the category of a data point using probability.\n",
    "- It assumes that all the features are independent each other.\n",
    "- It performs well in real-world applicants such as sentimeny analysis, document categorisation, spam filtering.\n",
    "### Key Features of Naive Bayes Classifiers:\n",
    "- The main idea behind the Naive Bayes Classifer is to use Bayes' Theroem to classify data based on the probabilities of different classes given the features of the data.\n",
    "- It is used mostly high-dimensional text classification.\n",
    "  1. It is a probabilistic classifier because it assumes each feature contribution to the predictions with no relation between each other.\n",
    "  2. It has very few parameters which are used to build ML models that can predict at a faster speed than other classification algorithms."

    "- This means when we are trying to classify something, we assume that each feature in the data does not affect any other feature.\n",
    "#### 2. Continous Features are normally distributed:\n",
    "- If a feature is continous, then it is assumed to be normally distributed within each class.\n",
    "#### 3. Discrete features have multinomial distribution:\n",
    "- If a feature is discrete, then it is assumed to be multinomial distribution within each class.\n",
    "#### 4. Features are equally important:\n",
    "- All features are assumed to contribute equally to the prediction of class label.\n",
    "#### 5. No missing values:\n",
    "- The data should not contains any missing values."

    "- There are three types of Navie Bayes Model -\n",
    "  #### 1. Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "  - It is also called as Normal distribution which plotted, it gives a bell shaped curve which is symmetric about the mean of the feature values as shown below.\n",
    "  - It continous values assoicated with each feature are assumed to be distributed according to a Gaussian Distrubution.\n",
    "  #### 2. Multinomial Naive Bayes:\n",
    "  - It is used when features are represent the frequency of terms in a document.\n",
    "  - It is commonly applied in text classification, where term frequencies are important.\n",
    "  #### 3. Bernoulli Navie Bayes:\n",
    "  - It deals with binary features, where each feature indicates wheather a word appears (or) not in a document.\n",
    "  - It is suited for scenarios where the presence (or) absence of terms is more relevant than their frequency.\n",
    "  - Both models are widely used in document classification tasks."
