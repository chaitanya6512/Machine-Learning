    "### Logistic Regresion \n",
    "- It is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems.\n",
    "- It predicts categorical values.\n",
    "- It is used for binary classification where the output can be one of two possible categories such as Yes/No, True/False (or)0/1.\n",
    "- It uses sigmoid function to convert inputs into a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "### Types of Logistic regression:\n",
    "#### 1. Binomial Logistic regression:\n",
    "- This type is used when the dependent variable has only two possible categories.\n",
    "- It is used for binary classification problems.\n",
    "- Eg - Yes/No, True/False, (or)0/1.\n",
    "#### 2. Multinomial Logistic Regression:\n",
    "- This type is used when dependent variable has two (or) more possible categories that are not ordered.\n",
    "- Eg - Classifying animals into categories like 'cat', 'dog', 'sheep'.\n",
    "- It extends the binary logistic regression to handle multiple classes.\n",
    "#### 3. Ordinal Logistic Regression:\n",
    "- This type is used for dependent variable has three (or) more possible categories with a natural order (or) ranking.\n",
    "- Eg - ratings like 'low', 'high', 'medium'.\n",
    "- It takes order of the categories into account when modeling."

    "### Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n",
    "#### 1. Independent observations:\n",
    "- Each datapoint is assumed to be independent of others means there should be no correlation (or) dependence between the input samples.\n",
    "#### 2. Binary dependent variables:\n",
    "- It takes the assumption that the dependent variable must be binary which means it takes only two values.For morethan two categories, we use Softmax functions are used.\n",
    "#### 3. Linearity relationship between independent variables and log odds:\n",
    "- The model assumes that the linear relationship between independent variables and log odds of the dependent variable which means the predictors affect the log odds in a linear way.\n",
    "#### 4. No outliers:\n",
    "- The dataset should not contain extreme outliers as they can distort the estimation of the logsitic regression coefficients.\n",
    "#### 5. Large sample size:\n",
    "- It requires a large sample size to produce reliable and stable results."

    "     - a. If the sigmoid value is above (or) same the threshold,the input must be classified as class1.\n",
